            The quotes from Elbert Hubbard inspired Faisal Mustafa at the time
            of his graduation. As a graduate student of Bangladesh University of
            Engineering and Technology in Civil Engineering, he wanted to do
            something he would love to, rather than he bound to. This is where
            he sailed his boat to SEO.
