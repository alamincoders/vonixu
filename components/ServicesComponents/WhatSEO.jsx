            </h1>
            <p className="text-[15px]">
              Local SEO, also referred to as local search, is a marketing
              strategy aimed to get your website seen in the top 10 organic
              positions on Google when customers near you search for your
              products online.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[15px]">
              Like traditional SEO, it focuses on increasing search engine
              rankings, but focuses on local keywords. There are two places to
              do thisâ€”Local Map Pack and Google SERPs (search engine results
              page).
            </p>
            <p className="text-[15px]">
              Local SEO is essential for achieving strong brand awareness in
              local communities. It can help businesses find potential customers
              and increase their book of business.
